# Project 6 Cross Platform API Management Project in Spring Boot        Role: Developer        Solo Project
Demo Project of Microservices.
I have created 3 seperated REST APIs
              a. USER - SERVICES            -> built using MySQL Database
              b. RATINGS - SREVICES         -> built using PostgreSQL Database
              c. HOTELS - SERVICES          -> built using MongoDb Database
These 3 REST Services built on different database or platform to give idea that we can use any type of services or built on any different platform in microservices.
